# Gradle

This folder contains various components required for the build process:

- The Gradle wrapper
- The [libs.versions.toml](https://github.com/pandulapeter/kubriko/blob/main/gradle/libs.versions.toml) file that defines the version numbers of all third party
  dependencies
- The `build-logic` project which contains pre-compiled Gradle plugins to reduce code duplication across the build scripts
