This repository contains the source code of the engine and its plugins / tooling, as well as the Kubriko Showcase application that demonstrates the engine's capabilities.

## üéÆ Overview
Kubriko aims to offer a lightweight, scalable, and easy-to-use solution for creating simple 2D games for **Android**, **Desktop** (Windows, Linux, MacOS), **iOS** and **Web**.
It achieves this goal by exposing a [Composable](https://www.jetbrains.com/compose-multiplatform/) that can easily be embedded into [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) projects.

The engine is highly modular, because its core functionality can be extended in a granular fashion using different plugins.
These plugins cover most needs of simple games; from viewport scaling and object management, through persistence, input handling and audio playback, all the way to shaders and physics simulation.
Kubriko also offers a number of tools, such as a Scene Editor, that can be useful during development.

The tech stack is easy to extend by creating custom plugins, and the low-level integration makes it possible to communicate with platform API-s in a straightforward way.

## üé® Showcase app
Clone this repository and run the `app` module for the supported targets (Android, Desktop, iOS, Web) to check out what the engine is capable of.

## üèóÔ∏è Project structure
This repository also serves as the documentation of the engine's feature set.

Each top-level folder / module has its own Readme file that contains high-level information about the relevant piece of functionality.
Classes and functions exposed in the public API are documented using KDoc.

The following folders are worth mentioning:
- [app](https://github.com/pandulapeter/kubriko/tree/main/app) - The menu system for the showcase app. It ties together the modules located in the `examples` folder.
- [documentation](https://github.com/pandulapeter/kubriko/tree/main/documentation) - Contains markdown files with an overview of the Kubriko API.
- [engine](https://github.com/pandulapeter/kubriko/tree/main/engine) - Defines the core components of Kubriko.
- [examples](https://github.com/pandulapeter/kubriko/tree/main/examples) - Contains the implementation of the games and demos of the showcase app.
- [plugins](https://github.com/pandulapeter/kubriko/tree/main/plugins) - These modules can be used to extend the functionality of Kubriko.
- [tools](https://github.com/pandulapeter/kubriko/tree/main/tools) - Extensions that can be useful during development such as the Scene Editor.
